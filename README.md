## This project is there for me to learn Kubernetes Deployment and Golang.

- Backend and Game Server written in Go
- Frontent UI written in React

### HOW TO RUN?
If you have kubectl installed and running you can start the backend with:
```bash
make deploy-backend
```

If you want to run the frontend you can use:
(Currently only in Dev mode)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Have fun lol!
